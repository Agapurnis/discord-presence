# Discord Presence

The root project for both [Bevy Discord Presence](https://crates.io/crates/bevy-discord-presence) and regular [Discord Presence](https://crates.io/crates/discord-presence), both contained in the crates directory.

## FAQ

### How do I get invites to work?
In all honesty, I'm not sure. That is a limitation with the current release, I have not given a standard way to implement join requests. I do plan on adding something in future but it will not be easy as there is no way of knowing what the end developer will use for their server and hence no way to ensure that my implementation works.

## Changelog

Both projects have their respective changelogs that can be viewed as follows:

- [Bevy Discord Presence](crates/bevy/CHANGELOG.md)
